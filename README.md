## Introduction

This project involves the integration of Decentralized Identity (DID) and Web5 technologies into an e-commerce website, providing users with a secure and privacy-centric authentication method.

## Project Overview

### Background

Traditional login systems often require users to share personal information, leading to privacy concerns. This project addresses these concerns by adopting a decentralized identity approach. Decentralized Identity (DID) is a new way for users to control their digital identities without relying on a central authority.

DIDs are based on blockchain technology and provide a secure and private means of authentication. Omniverse is an advanced web project that embraces the principles of decentralization, enhanced security, and user privacy.

### Decentralized Identity (DID)

Decentralized Identity is a new paradigm in digital identity management that allows users to have control over their own identity without relying on centralized authorities. DIDs are based on blockchain technology and provide a secure and private means of authentication.

### Objectives

- [ ] Implement DID for user authentication.
- [ ] Solving the issue of companies managing and selling your data
- [ ] Utilize SDK for seamless interaction with decentralized systems.
- [ ] To make web apps totally decentralized

## Project Architecture

### High-Level Overview

The project architecture involves the integration of DID for user authentication, utilizing Web5 principles for decentralized data storage and SDK for seamless integration. Next.js serves as the frontend framework for building a responsive and dynamic user interface.

### DID Integration

DID integration involves user registration, issuance of unique DIDs, and secure authentication using cryptographic principles

### Web5 Integration

Web5 is utilized for decentralized data storage, ensuring that user data is distributed across a network, enhancing data security and availability.

### SDK Implementation

The SDK is implemented to provide developers with the necessary tools for interacting with DIDs and Web5 within the application.

### Next.js Setup

Next.js is used to build a dynamic and responsive user interface, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Achievements 
### Enhanced User Privacy
Users benefit from increased privacy as personal information is no longer required for login.

### Password-Free Authentication
The implementation of DID provides a secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based authentication.

### Scalable and Secure System
The architecture ensures scalability and security, accommodating a growing user base while maintaining data integrity.

## Future Improvements
### Additional DID Methods
Exploring and integrating additional DID methods to provide users with more options for identity management.

###  Enhanced User Experience
Continuing to refine the user interface and experience based on user feedback and emerging design trends.
